# I know it's inefficient :)

But it is predictable and straightforward. Just a simple sleep function for THOSE WHO CAN'T SLEEP AT 3 AM

The key here is that setTimeout is asyncronous <s>and also ugly</s>, whereas Python's time.sleep() is not, which is very useful for debugging sometimes.

So use my version as follows: 

`sleep(28800)`

### **sleep2.js:** added an optional fps parameter to save CPU

`sleep(100, 24)`
